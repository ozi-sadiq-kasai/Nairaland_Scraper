He has come out publicly on more than five different occasions to challenge Nigerians about his being involved in any corrupt or criminal dealings, he will throw in the towel on his quest to be President. Can other candidates pose such a challenge?2. He challenge the Northerners at the Arewa forum that if he had deported anybody or issued an ID card to anyone while as governor in Anambra state, he will give up on bidding. He asked anyone to come out and vilify him on that, everywhere was silent.3. He kept on saying that Nigerians should not vote for him because he is Igbo to pacify Igbos, do not vote for him because he is a Christian. Do not vote for him because of the region, rotation, or turn. Instead, vote for him because of Character you can trust, competence, credibility, and capacity. He doesn't play tribal or religious politics.4. If he can achieve the feat of securing Anambra state and being commended by the then IGP as Anambra being the most secured state in Nigeria as a governor, I believe he can do wonders as a Commander in chief of the Armed forces.5. He has been challenging anyone that cares that he never embezzled or misappropriate state funds as a governor. If anyone found him wanting on that, he will throw in the towel. [An opposition party to his is presently governing Anambra]5. He didn't borrow for 8 years as governor, owe no salary, even offset a backlog of arrears, save and left a very huge amount of money for the state, and receive no pension, property, or material after leaving office.6. Built a lot of infrastructures, achieve a huge turnaround in Education, reduced the unemployment rate in Anambra, and made it more viable.7.

He has come out publicly on more than five different occasions to challenge Nigerians about his being involved in any corrupt or criminal dealings, he will throw in the towel on his quest to be President. Can other candidates pose such a challenge?2. He challenge the Northerners at the Arewa forum that if he had deported anybody or issued an ID card to anyone while as governor in Anambra state, he will give up on bidding. He asked anyone to come out and vilify him on that, everywhere was silent.3. He kept on saying that Nigerians should not vote for him because he is Igbo to pacify Igbos, do not vote for him because he is a Christian. Do not vote for him because of the region, rotation, or turn. Instead, vote for him because of Character you can trust, competence, credibility, and capacity. He doesn't play tribal or religious politics.4. If he can achieve the feat of securing Anambra state and being commended by the then IGP as Anambra being the most secured state in Nigeria as a governor, I believe he can do wonders as a Commander in chief of the Armed forces.5. He has been challenging anyone that cares that he never embezzled or misappropriate state funds as a governor. If anyone found him wanting on that, he will throw in the towel. [An opposition party to his is presently governing Anambra]5. He didn't borrow for 8 years as governor, owe no salary, even offset a backlog of arrears, save and left a very huge amount of money for the state, and receive no pension, property, or material after leaving office.6. Built a lot of infrastructures, achieve a huge turnaround in Education, reduced the unemployment rate in Anambra, and made it more viable.7.

He has come out publicly on more than five different occasions to challenge Nigerians about his being involved in any corrupt or criminal dealings, he will throw in the towel on his quest to be President. Can other candidates pose such a challenge?2. He challenge the Northerners at the Arewa forum that if he had deported anybody or issued an ID card to anyone while as governor in Anambra state, he will give up on bidding. He asked anyone to come out and vilify him on that, everywhere was silent.3. He kept on saying that Nigerians should not vote for him because he is Igbo to pacify Igbos, do not vote for him because he is a Christian. Do not vote for him because of the region, rotation, or turn. Instead, vote for him because of Character you can trust, competence, credibility, and capacity. He doesn't play tribal or religious politics.4. If he can achieve the feat of securing Anambra state and being commended by the then IGP as Anambra being the most secured state in Nigeria as a governor, I believe he can do wonders as a Commander in chief of the Armed forces.5. He has been challenging anyone that cares that he never embezzled or misappropriate state funds as a governor. If anyone found him wanting on that, he will throw in the towel. [An opposition party to his is presently governing Anambra]5. He didn't borrow for 8 years as governor, owe no salary, even offset a backlog of arrears, save and left a very huge amount of money for the state, and receive no pension, property, or material after leaving office.6. Built a lot of infrastructures, achieve a huge turnaround in Education, reduced the unemployment rate in Anambra, and made it more viable.7.

Just watch and see. 1 Like  Re: 2023: Peter Obi Is One Of The Finest Presidential Candidates – Ortom by Jiokejohn(m): 9:38am On Nov 03Mr. Peter Obi towers higher than others.I am voting for Peter Obi of the labor party because of the following reasons.1. He has come out publicly on more than five different occasions to challenge Nigerians about his being involved in any corrupt or criminal dealings, he will throw in the towel on his quest to be President. Can other candidates pose such a challenge?2. He challenge the Northerners at the Arewa forum that if he had deported anybody or issued an ID card to anyone while as governor in Anambra state, he will give up on bidding. He asked anyone to come out and vilify him on that, everywhere was silent.3. He kept on saying that Nigerians should not vote for him because he is Igbo to pacify Igbos, do not vote for him because he is a Christian. Do not vote for him because of the region, rotation, or turn. Instead, vote for him because of Character you can trust, competence, credibility, and capacity. He doesn't play tribal or religious politics.4. If he can achieve the feat of securing Anambra state and being commended by the then IGP as Anambra being the most secured state in Nigeria as a governor, I believe he can do wonders as a Commander in chief of the Armed forces.5. He has been challenging anyone that cares that he never embezzled or misappropriate state funds as a governor. If anyone found him wanting on that, he will throw in the towel. [An opposition party to his is presently governing Anambra]5. He didn't borrow for 8 years as governor, owe no salary, even offset a backlog of arrears, save and left a very huge amount of money for the state, and receive no pension, property, or material after leaving office.6. Built a lot of infrastructures, achieve a huge turnaround in Education, reduced the unemployment rate in Anambra, and made it more viable.7. Strong and very healthy, accessible to Nigerians, and has been speaking to and engaging Nigerians.What else are we looking for in a leader?Can other candidates make a similar assertion? 16 Likes   1 ShareRe: 2023: Peter Obi Is One Of The Finest Presidential Candidates – Ortom by Thebigheart: 9:39am On Nov 03lhordspy:Ortom, the lowest irrelevant member of the 5-PDP breakaway governors.
